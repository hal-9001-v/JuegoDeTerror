Day 1 since the new study began:

A creature never seen before entered the bunker while the helicopter was coming through the secondary entrance/exit. 
We were able to capture it with no losses and trap it inside a capsule. We have since started various tests.

It seems like this creature is what is left of life on the surface. We must be extremely cautious when approaching it, 
since no one knows how it may react under stress, even if it is trapped right now.
