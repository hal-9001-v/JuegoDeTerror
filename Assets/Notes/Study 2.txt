Day 2 since the new study began:

The creature has proven extremely resistant towards any human presence. However, to our surprise, it has not tried to escape, not even once.
If any human steps close to the capsule, it will start growling and making some kind of guttural gargle, while trying to hide from any surveillance.

When not watched by the scientist, only the security cameras, the creature will behave like a predator. Its movements are extremely quiet, apart from the 
throaty noises. It appears to attack from the preyâ€™s back, probably in just one stroke.
