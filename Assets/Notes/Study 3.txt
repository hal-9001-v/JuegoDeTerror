ay 3 since the new study began:

The creature now seems more relaxed and has started secreting a thick substance. We cannot get into the capsule in order to take
 any kind of sample, since anyone would suffer a sudden death before even trying to leave the room.

It seems to have developed an interest in shiny objects, such as the keys used to open the security doors.
In case the creature somehow escapes the capsule, a new security system is being installed throughout the whole bunker.
