Day 4 since the new study began:
	We have finally managed to get some drawings and radiographies of relevant parts of the creature’s body. It looks like its eyes, somehow snake-like, allow it to easily spot a prey in the darkness, but are sensitive to red, making it flinch sometimes before a red light.
Little suckers in its 4 phalanxes fingers allow it to climb and stick to the walls and ceiling. Combined with it’s incredible stealth, this thing could be a perfect predator.
The installation of the new security system is progressing quickly, in order to minimize the danger this thing could cause.


Day 5 since the new study began:
	Since we cannot enter the capsule this creature is in, we are not able to feed it at all. That means we will only be able to study it until it dies of starvation. However, this can probably unveil a whole new behaviour from the subject. 
It’s aggresiveness seems to be growing as days pass, probably because of the lack of food and water, although no attemps of escaping have been registered yet.


Day 6 since the new study began:
	The creature has now developed an extremely aggresive behaviour towards any human that comes close enough to the capsule. It will soon starve to death, so we must hurry in order to collect as much data as possible.
We have been able to spot a sting on the tip of the creature’s tail, probably stuck out because of the stress it is going through. We have not been able to determine the hardness of the sting, so we don’t know if it could break the capsule’s security glass.
