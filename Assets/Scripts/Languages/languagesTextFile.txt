Day 1 since the new study began:

Study1P2
A never seen before creature entered the bunker while the helicopter was entering the secondary entrance/exit. We were able to capture it with no losses and trap it inside a capsule. We have since started various tests.

Study1P3
It seems like this creatures is what is left of life on the surface. We must be extremely cautious when approaching it, since no one knows how it may react under stress, even if it is trapped now.

Day 2 since the new study began:
D
;
Study1P5
The creature has proven extremely reluctant towards any human presence. However, to our surprise, it has not tried to escape, not even once. If any human steps close to the capsule, it will start growling and making some kind of guttural gargle, while trying to hide from any surveillance.

Study1P6
When not paid attention by the scientist, but only the security cameras, the creature will behave like a predator. It’s movements are extremely quiet, apart from the throaty noises. It appears to attack from the prey’s back, probably in just one stroke.

Day 3 since the new study began:
D
;
Study1P8
The creature now seems more relaxed and has started secreting a thick substance. We cannot get in the capsule in order to take any kind of sample, since anyone would suffer a sudden death before even trying to exit the room.
D
;
Study1P9
It seems to have developed an interest in shiny objects, such as the keys used to open the security doors.
D

Study1P10
In case the creature somehow escapes the capsule, a new security system is being installed over the whole bunker.
